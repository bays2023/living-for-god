\subsection{Who God Is}
\noindent
If one wants to please God, it is integral that he or she first has a proper understanding of who He is.
When man does not take this into account, even if done with the right intentions, he will ultimately create a false god or another Jesus (\citeverse{2 Corinthians 11:1-4}{2Corinthians 11:1-4}).
These gods take many forms, namely other deities (Islam, Hinduism), the self (Buddhism, Atheism, Satanism), or systems or sets of principles (Confucianism, Communism).
\\

\noindent
The most pernicious form of false deity is that which is closest to appearing to actually being God.
It is much easier for a well-meaning serious Christian to be deceived into believing something not true about God than to wholly fall away from the faith.
The danger with this is that as one continues without having his or her error corrected, that error usually and likely grows to affect other assertions about God, leading to a possible complete unraveling of an accurate understanding of the Lord.
\\

\noindent
Ultimately, it is impossible for any person to fully know everything about God or to be perfectly accurate every time in his or her statements and ideas concerning the Lord; however, God does reveal and define Himself through His word (\citeverse{John 1:1-2}{John 1:1-2}).
Thus, using what God says about Himself, we will attempt to	get close to understanding who God really is.
\\

\subsubsection{One Lord}
\noindent
A major part of the foundation of Old Testament law is that God is one (\citeverse{Mark 12:29-31}{Mark 12:29-31}).
This fact is repeated throughout the Old Testament (Ex: \citeverse{Isaiah 45:5-6}{Isaiah 45:5-6}, \citeverse{Zechariah 14:9}{Zechariah 14:9}) and New Testament (Ex: \citeverse{Ephesians 4:5-6}{Ephesians 4:5-6}, \citeverse{James 2:19}{James 2:19}).
\\

\noindent
God is not a being with three spheres of consciousness or persons, but is one.
Jesus Christ is not separate from The Father, but as recorded in Philippians 2:6-8: ``Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: but made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men: and being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.''
The one mediator between God and men (\citeverse{1 Timothy 2:5-6}{1Timothy 2:5-6}) is both God and man.

\subsubsection{God is Love}
\noindent
John makes it clear in his epistle that one cannot know God without having love because God is love (\citeverse{1 John 4:8}{1John 4:8}).
Love is a defining attribute of God, of which one's perception of and relationship with God will be fundamentally flawed if this attribute is not properly recognized.
